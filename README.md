## Overview

**Project Title**: Time Slime

**Project Description**: A simple 2D platformer featuring a slime that travels through time.

**Project Goals**: Understanding how to design and create a game using Unity and programming in C#.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. To play the game, you will need to download one of the three versions in the ```Game``` folder depending on your operating system. In order to do so, we will be using a website to do so easily. If you wish to use another method feel free to do so. Go to one of the three versions (Linux, macOS, or Windows) and copy the url above. For instance, for Windows I'd copy this link ```https://github.com/NoahWMerrell/time-slime/tree/main/Game/Windows-TimeSlime```.
2. Next go to the [GitHub Directory Downloader](https://download-directory.github.io/) website and past the copied link to download the sub directory.
3. Once you finish downloading, unzip the file somewhere on your device.

Instructions for using the software:

1. To start the software varies depending on your operating system. For windows you just need to run the ```Time Slime.exe``` file.
2. Once the game has finished loading, you can move left using ```A``` and right using ```D```. To jump, press the spacebar and press it again while in the air to double jump.
3. To see your past self from 3 seconds ago, press ```Q```. Note: this has a 6 second cooldown which does not have a visual indicator. Right now it serves no purpose other than visual.
4. Feel free to explore the test map! If you fall off the ledge the game will simply restart.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Unity
* Unity Hub
* .NET SDK
* Visual Studio Code (or another IDE)

Due to the size of a Unity project it is likely not easily possible to access the same development environment I had. Feel free to contact me if needed.

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/)
* [YouTube Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcranVQUQ5U&list=PLgOEwFbvGm5o8hayFB6skAfa8Z-mw4dPV) (I used various tutorials, but this is the one that was most helpful for getting started)
* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) (Primarily for getting started and debugging code)
* [GitHub Directory Downloader](https://download-directory.github.io/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [X] Basic movement (jumping and moving left and right)
* [X] Double jumping
* [X] Jump buffering
* [X] Time travel mechanic
* [ ] Polish time Travel mechanic and clone
* [X] TileMapping to construct a basic map for testing
* [X] Simple respawn mechanic
* [ ] Objects that can be interacted with (like a lever, pressure plate, or moving platform)
* [ ] Coyote time
